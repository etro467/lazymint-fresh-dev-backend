Gemini
Here's a checklist of the project's status based on the provided file list and the details from the resources prompts:

Project Initialization: Firebase project setup, including firebase.json, firestore.rules, and storage.rules.
Core Backend Structure: Established functions/src directory with index.ts for API entry point, config/environment.ts for environment variables, and utils/auth.ts for authentication utilities.
Fundamental Middleware and Utilities: Implementation of shared error handling (shared/errors.ts), middleware (shared/middleware.ts), and validation logic (shared/validation.ts).
Type Definitions: Established core data models for Users, Campaigns, and Claims within types/user.ts, types/campaign.ts, types/campaign/index.ts, and types/claim/index.ts.
Initial User Management: Basic handlers for user-related operations are likely in place, indicated by handlers/userHandlers.ts.
Authentication Middleware Refinement: The functions/src/shared/middleware.ts file is currently being edited, indicating active development and refinement of the authentication flow. This is crucial for securing all API endpoints.
Campaign Management Logic: The presence of handlers/campaignHandlers.ts suggests that the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for campaigns are actively being developed.
Claims Processing Logic: Similarly, handlers/claimHandlers.ts indicates ongoing work on the claims workflow, which involves email verification and ticket generation.
API Endpoint Integration: With handlers in place, the integration of these handlers into the main index.ts file to expose API endpoints is likely underway.
Email Verification Flow: While types suggest email verification is part of the user and claim flow, the full integration with an email service provider and the complete verification process are likely being implemented or refined.
Frontend/User Interface (UI): There are no visible files related to a web or mobile frontend, which would be essential for creators to manage campaigns and users to claim digital assets.
QR Code Generation Implementation: While QR codes are a core feature, the specific implementation for generating these dynamically is not explicitly present in the file list.
Digital Ticket Generation: The process for generating and securely storing the actual "digital tickets" post-claim is not clearly delineated by existing files.
AI-Enhanced Features (Pro Tier):
AI-generated QR code designs.
Automated ticket background generation. These advanced features, part of the "Pro Tier," do not appear to have dedicated files or modules indicating their development.
Analytics Platform Integration: Connecting to external analytics services for creator insights and platform metrics.
Payment Processing: Integration with a payment gateway for managing subscription tiers (Free, Basic, Pro).
Advanced Scalability Optimizations: While Firebase provides scalability, specific code-level optimizations or stress testing for handling viral growth (0 to 10,000 claims in hours) are not evident.
Comprehensive Fraud Prevention: Beyond basic validation, more sophisticated mechanisms to prevent claim fraud and duplicate submissions.
Real-time Campaign Analytics: Implementation for providing creators with real-time insights into campaign performance and claim tracking.
